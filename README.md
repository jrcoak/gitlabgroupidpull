# gitlabgroupidpull
Simple way that I shared with the SE team to pull all group ids provisioned for a user in gitlab and return them in a comma separated format.

Having these as a comma separated list is required for connection of Gitlab to Jellyfish. 

pullid.py is a python script
curl.txt is a curl command that completes the same action.
